            Time Spent
   Date     13 (hours)   Description of Work
----------  ----------  -------------------------
2023-1-18      1     Decide approach - outline expected output. Copied it in the top of my code as reference.
2023-1-18      2     Work on get_word_list() spend time cleaning/shaping the word_list. Add re module. Add call to main(). Used print to test.
2023-1-18      1     add_keywords() function creates the user input keyword_list. Nothing new here. Add call to main(). Used print to test.
2023-1-18      1     word_count() add word counts to the word_list to create the word_count_dict. Gotta love count(). Add call to main(). Used print to test.
2023-1-18      1     add both sorted_highest_usage() and sorted_alphabetical(). Tested but did not implement yet. Used print to test lists.
2023-1-19      1     Enter threshold input to main() with try/exception for redundant words shown.
2023-1-19      1     get_full_list_option() add in the 2 sort options for sorted full dictionary output.
2023-1-19      1     Add get_threshold_words(). Then add to main() both keyword and sorted full list calls.
2023-1-19      1     Add get_keyword_counts(). Compare keywords to dict and output keyword with dict count. Used debugger to test.
2023-1-19      1     Spend time cleaning up code and spacing. Also add Intro and Footer.
2023-1-19      2     Create 3 test cases in Pytest. Two that test word_count() and one that tests the key value for sorted_highest_usage(). Finished!



2. Write the names of the functions in your program.
main, get_word_list, add_keywords, word_count, sorted_highest_usage, sorted_alphabetical, get_full_list_option, get_threshold_words, get_keyword_counts


3. Answer the following questions about the functions in your program.
    a. Does each function perform a single task?
    It does per the naming description, with some subtasks mixed in.

    b. Does the name of each function describe or convey the task?
    Yes.

    c. Do most of your program functions have parameters and return a result?
    Some return values, some perform output based on conditions.

    If you answered "no" to any of the above three questions, what are
    you planning to change in your project?
    --NA--


4. Write the names of the test functions that you wrote to test your
program functions.
test_word_count_returns_dictionary_of_single_words, test_word_count_returns_dictionary_of_duplicate_words, test_sorted_key_value_are_working
