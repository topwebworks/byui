CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program - Brett Snyder
I chose from the provided "Possible Projects" list item #3:
-> A program that reads a text file and counts how often each word occurs in the file.

1. What is the title of your program?
    Word Counter

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    A. In Marketing, having too much of the same word will sound redundant in an article.
    B. More importantly in website SEO, having several of the target keywords is ideal.
    
    Expected Output

    Title
    Instruction    

    Inputs:
      1. File to read (ie., proposal.txt):
      2. Add keyword to scan? or (done)
      3. Redundant word threshold (0-100+): 

    Output:
      Scanned Keywords:
      'keyword1' used 5 times.
      'keyword2' not found.
      ...  

      Threshold Words:
      3 - word 1
      5 - word 6
      ... 

      Print full word list? (yes or no):
      Sort by: (alpha, hilow, or end):
      8 - word 21
      5 - word 6
      2 words used over 5 times.
      ...

      200 Words scanned in article_name. Goodbye!
      Date/Time Stamp

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    A. Reading a file
    B. Try Exception when entering the file name
    C. Sort and output the file word data calculating each word occurrence.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    datetime, pytest, os, re

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    Yes, I will use a standard procedural programming approach: read_file(), parameters, arguments, etc.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
    Yes, to check main word list that they are counting correctly. Also, if the sort function is passing key values.
