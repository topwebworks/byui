----------  ----------  -------------------------
2023-1-18      1     Decide approach - outline expected output. Copied it in the top of my code as reference.
2023-1-18      2     Work on get_word_list() spend time cleaning/shaping the word_list. Add re module. Add call to main(). Used print to test.
2023-1-18      1     add_keywords() function creates the user input keyword_list. Nothing new here. Add call to main(). Used print to test.
2023-1-18      1     word_count() add word counts to the word_list to create the word_count_dict. Gotta love count(). Add call to main(). Used print to test.
2023-1-18      1     add both sorted_highest_usage() and sorted_alphabetical(). Tested but did not implement yet. Used print to test lists.
2023-1-19      1     Enter threshold input to main() with try/exception for redundant words shown.
2023-1-19      1     get_full_list_option() add in the 2 sort options for sorted full dictionary output.
2023-1-19      1     Add get_threshold_words(). Then add to main() both keyword and sorted full list calls.
2023-1-19      1     Add get_keyword_counts(). Compare keywords to dict and output keyword with dict count. Used debugger to test.
2023-1-19      1     Spend time cleaning up code and spacing. Also add Intro and Footer.
2023-1-19      2     Create 3 test cases in Pytest. Two that test word_count() and one that tests the key value for sorted_highest_usage(). Finished!


2. In I-Learn, submit this completed text file, your Python program, your
Python test file, and any project data files such as .txt and .csv files.

NOTE: This report_2.txt time data is the same as report_1.txt as I had already finished the project. 13 hrs total.
